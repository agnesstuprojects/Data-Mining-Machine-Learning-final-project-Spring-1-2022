Churn Prediction in Telecoms Industry Using R 

Telecommunication market is expanding day by day. Companies are facing a severe loss of revenue due to increasing competition hence the loss of customers. They are trying to find the reasons of losing customers by measuring customer loyalty to regain the lost customers. The customers leaving the current company and moving to another telecom company are called churn. This Analysis will use ANN and SVM models to find the best model for the study.
